itermcolors-monoized
=====================

Monoized, a modified (grey-base) offshoot of [Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized).

#### Reasoning

Solarized is awesome in both form and function. 

Except for one thing: I just could not get over the murky blue/green base color. I don't know why, but there's no accounting for taste.

What I did instead is just to 'remove the offender' in the sense that I created a colorscheme with:

- the same accent colors
- the same L*a*b lightness relationships through the 'base' colors
- zero hue in the base set

So, essentially, it's a mono version. Monoized.

Note:  Right now, this is only really effective if you are controlling the base 16 terminal colors (e.g. an .Xresources palette or Terminal/iTerm color set.)
